            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F those thinges which are necessary vnto the perfection of a Christian life, the first and chiefest is, the continuall consideration and remembrance of God and his holy commandements. For this is a most stronge bridle to restraine our heartes that they follow not their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate appetites, and a most effectuall remedy, to conserue the estate both of the inward and outward man. This is a most stronge buckler to receue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177884:4"/> the dartes of all our enemies. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer this is an admirable meanes that God may alwaies worke in vs and heape vp his giftes and graces in our soules. For although God is as it were a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine springe or fountaine, incessantly flowinge, and as much as is of his parte most ready to deriue vnto vs the waters of his grace, wherunto he inuiteth all men: yet it is necessary, we repaire and approach vnto him, that we way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceue them. And hereupon the Prophet Dauid saith. <hi>(Psal.</hi> 33.) Come vnto him and be illuminated, and your faces shall not be confounded. And in another place speakinge of the continuall remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce he had of God. My eyes, saith he, are alwaies vpon our Lord, because he will pull my feete out of the snare. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he saith. I had God alwayes in my sight because he is at my right hand that I be not moued Where the Glosse of Cassiodorus saith: By declaring what he himselfe did, he geueth vs instruction
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177884:5"/> what wee ought to doe. For he that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beholdeth God with the eye of his minde, can in no sorte auerte his minde vnto sinne. And Saint Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene saith: that the remembrance of God ought to be so continuall in vs, that we should not more often drawe our breath, then remember God: and this continuall remembrāce of God he saith, expelleth all sadnes from our soules, and that with meruailous much ioye and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation. Which the princely Prophet Dauid confirmeth saying: my soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to be comforted (that is to say, in the thinges of this present life) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God, and was comforted. S. Bernard saith. As there is no moment wherin a man doth not vse and enioye the goodnes and mercie of God, so ought there to be no momēt wherin we should not haue him present in our minde Saint Gregory the Pope exhorteth vs, that we continually haue him in our memory, by whō our memory was made. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177884:5"/> place declaring how profitable this cōtinuall memory of God is, he saith. No euill spirit can preuaile in that heart, which is continually occupied in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēbrance of God. Saint Ambrose admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth vs, that whether we eate or drinke or whatsoeuer we doe, we should alwaies expresse Christ, thinke of Christ, pray vnto Christ, speake with Christ inwardly in our hartes, and that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer depart out of our mouth. S. Ierome saith. As a souldier ought neuer to a lay away his armour in battaile: So euery Christian ought in euery place to arme himselfe with praier. When he goeth forth he should arme himself with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he returneth home, prayer should be the first thinge he should doe.</p>
            <p>This continuall consideration and remembrance of God, may be done chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie two manner of wayes, either by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge some certaine and set considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our owne, chosinge to meditate therof, or to take occasion by those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177884:6"/> which occurre to our sight, or those businesses we haue in hande, to lifte vpp our hearts vnto God. The former way is harder and requireth a man very well practised in the recollection of himselfe: it requireth also a minde quiet and free from all businesses, and therfore is more proper for Religious and solitarie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>The other is easier, because, besides the varietie wherewith our nature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and tediousnes taken awaie, those thinges wee see with our eyes, and those businesses wee haue in hande, doe easily stirre vp and incite our hearts vnto God, being a little inured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Which kinde of exercise, men may vse though neuer so much occupied and employed in externall affaires. And her-unto Saint Paule the Apostle exhorteth all faithfull people, in his Epistle to the Corinthians in these wordes. Speakinge to your selues in Psalmes, Hymnes and spirituall Canticles, singinge in your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177884:6"/> hearts to our Lord, geuinge thankes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for all thinges to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>I therfore, that I might promote this holy exercise as much as in mee lyeth, haue thought it a matter worth the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to write this Manuall, wherin I might set downe a methode, how out of all things wee doe or see, wee may take occasion to lifte vp our hearts to God, either by some shorte sentence of holie Scripture which directly concerneth the presēt matter, or by some Consideration or Thankesgiuing, or Confusion, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, or Oblation. Not that wee tye the readers to exercise them all at once: but that euery one in so great varietie of matter, may take that he shall thinke most conuenient for his condition and spirit. Or if besides these which are here sett downe (for wee cannot speake of all in particuler) any other shall offer it selfe to his minde, he may the better
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177884:7"/> know how to supplie it to his vse.</p>
            <p>This Manuall wee haue not written, ōly to be read &amp; perused, for that were a matter of small profit, but that the thinges therein contayned might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised and put in practise, which who so shall doe and continue therin a fewe dayes: I doubt not but he shal receiue in his soule such noble fruite, that he will thinke all his labour and paines taken therin, wonderfull well bestowed, and he shall performe that spiritually which was commaunded the priests in the olde law, namely that they should feede and nourish with wodd, the fire which was to burne continually before the Arke of the Couenāt, for by this meanes he shal conserue and keepe in himselfe, the fire of deuotion and loue of God, which ought continually to burne in our heart, which is the Altar whereon wee should offerr the spirituall sacrifices of holie thoughtes and desires. Almightie God graunt grace vnto all faithfull people of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177884:7"/> Christ, that they minde him in all their workes, and in all thinges fulfill his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie will. Amen.</p>

               <p>We are therefore to consider, that in the celebratiō of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, three thinges are principally done, each of which are full of many misteries.</p>
               <p>The first is, that therein bread and wine is consecrated (as Christ did in his last supper, he geuinge power, and authoritie to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and al priestes lawfully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, so to doe) and by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this consecration, the bread <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:177884:117"/> the true body of Christ our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the wine into his true bloud; in somuch that after the consecration, there is contayned whole &amp; entire Christ truly, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and substantially, vnder the formes of bread and wine.</p>
               <p>The second is, that therein the body and bloud of Christ our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, is offered vnder the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of bread and wine, as a most gratefull and acceptable sacrifice to God the Father, and the whole most sacred and vndeuided Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the priest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath offered vpp this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, receaueth the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, as a Sacrament, vnto the vtilitie and profit of his owne soule, if he receaue it worthily, and with due disposition.</p>
               <p>Out of this which we haue said, we may vnderstand how high thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:177884:117"/> mistery is, &amp; how great attētion, reuerence and deuotion, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ought to be present with, at the holy sacrifice of the Masse. For asmuch as therin is handled, so high a mistery &amp; benefit, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not only the priest that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth it, but also all they that are presenteth thereat with due disposition and reuerence, are made pertakers. Wherefore that we may more exactly declare it.</p>
               <p>First for asmuch as in the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se is consecrated the bodie and bloud of Christ, and by virtue of this consecration, the same Christ is really presēt on the Altar, great attention and reuerence ought to be in the heart of a Christiā, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe or seruinge Masse: and also a vehement desire to heare it eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day, not only on those dayes, when he is bound by the precept of the Church to heare it, &amp; not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:177884:118"/> only one Masse a day, but many if he can, and haue opprotunitie so to doe. For Christ saith vnto his Disciples, blessed are the eyes which see that which you see. For I say vnto you many Prophets, &amp; Kinges haue desired to see those thinges which you see, and haue not seene them, meaning himself.</p>
               <p>But the same Lord whom they saw, and with whom the Apostles conuersed, and for whom theire eyes were pronounced blessed, is really present on the Altar, where the sacrifice of the Masse is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated after the cōsecration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the eyes of al that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent doe truely beholde him. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though veiled and hidden vnder the formes of bread and wine.

               <p>To come to the third parte of the Masse, that is to say, the holy Communion, when the priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth the body and bloud of Christ.

And although the priest only doth Sacramentally, receaue the body and bloud of Christ, yet notwithstandinge he that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at Masse, may spiritually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the same, which he shall doe by consideringe the greatnes of this benefit, and by geuinge thankes to God for the same, as is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:177884:127"/> aforesaid; Also by desiringe, and with feruent prayer, beseechinge God to worke in our soules, those effects for which this Sacrament was instituted and ordayned, that is to say, that Christ may dwell in vs, and we in him, and that wee may be vnited to him, by true &amp; perfecte loue and conformitie to his will, and that by reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we dyinge to our selues, that is to say, to the desires and appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the flesh, the world and our owne will, and continually ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to fulfill his will which is altogether holy and perfecte, he may liue in vs, and wee in him.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:177884:128"/> that celebrate the same, who ought to applie them selues to greater puritie of soule, and to greater attention and deuotion, then those who heare the same, because they concurre more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vnto the celebration of these high misteries, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the words of Christ, doe both consecrete the bloud of Christ, and offer it with theire handes in the person of Christ, &amp; receaue it Sacramētally vnder the formes. And that the sacrifice of the Masse may be celebrated with the more reuerence and deuotion, our holy Mother the Church, hath instituted certaine ceremonies, moste holie and full of misteries, which the prieste vseth in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Masse, aswell in the garmēts or vestmēts which he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on, as in the rest of the Masse by prayers, signes, inclinations of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:177884:128"/> the body, and reuerences. Most of which were vsed anon after the Apostles time, as it appeareth by the Masse of S. Iames, which is exant in his life, and by the Masse of S. Clement the Disciple, and fellow of S. Peter, which is extant in the eight booke of the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Apostles, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very consonant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that a Christian should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and reuerence all thinges, which are done in the Masse, yea euen he that vnderstandeth not what they signifie.</p>
               <p>And because by that which hath bene alreadie said, it appeareth sufficiently in what things he that heareth Masse ought to occupie himselfe, we will omit diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther misteries of the Masse, which may be found in other bookes, &amp; only declare these that follow.</p>
